      Addiction is the absolute dependency on a particular substance or
      situation. The problem in our society with addiction is that it is treated
      like a choice than as a major problem faced by an individual. Mr. Gunjan
      Chaudhary spoke about a variety of issues like addiction of phone, drugs,
      alcohol and many more which impacted all students and created awareness
      amongst youth to live a healthy life and not become a pray to substance
      addiction. Post seminar students were given the opportunity to inquire and
      discuss about various queries on addiction and how can one come out of
      these self-destructive habits. During this discussion participants were
      given background information about the casue and effect of addiction. This
      discussion lasted about 20 minutes. Students also interacted personally
      with Mr. Gunjan Chaudhary and Shivanshu Singh to inquire personal
      questions. Participants in the session reached the consensus that
      De-addiction is the need of time and discussed about related barriers and
      solutions
